# Analysing DATA - Python, Pandas, Numpy and Star Trek

Here you find some Ipython notebooks for analysing the "Star Trek The Next Generation" episodes.

1. I had to download and clean the data, which was a good practice in **startrekng-episodes-analysis_01.ipynb**.
2. I did some statistical analysis of dataset with python, numpy and pandas in **startrekng-episodes-analysis_02.ipynb**.
3. Finally we arrived in **startrekng-episodes-analysis_03.ipynb**, where I concentrate on predicting the speakers with the use of 2 algorithms: the „Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency“  and „Multinomial Naive Bayes“ („sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer“ and „sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB“)



**Source of the raw data was actually http://www.chakoteya.net/NextGen/ - Thanks a lot for transcribing all the episodes!**

I hope you like what I get out of the your data!
